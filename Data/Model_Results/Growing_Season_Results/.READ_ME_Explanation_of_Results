The results in this folder are not included in the paper or the results of the study. 
The results here explore the possibility that the accuracy of the SWBR-13 and NINA-ET models would be changed (improved or worsened) if they were optimized using only data from the growing season.
There was not a significant difference in accuracy with either model and thus these exploratory results were not included.
